# React Hono Starter Kit

This is a **React Hono Starter Kit** that integrates with **Better Auth** for authentication. It provides a boilerplate for building modern web applications with a React frontend and a Hono-based backend.

## Features

- **React** for the frontend.
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling.
- **Hono** as the backend framework.
- **Better Auth** for authentication and session management.
- **Sqlite** wil be used as the Database for better-auth but you can choose the db of your choice for anything else.
- Pre-configured with TypeScript for type safety.
